          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-yellow-400 mb-4">
            1. Code Editors and IDEs
          </h2>
          <p className="mb-6">
            A powerful code editor is a must for any developer. Visual Studio
            Code continues to dominate the market with its vast array of
            extensions and customization options. Alternatives like JetBrains
            WebStorm are also worth exploring.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-yellow-400 mb-4">
            2. Version Control Systems
          </h2>
          <p className="mb-6">
            Git remains the gold standard for version control. Platforms like
            GitHub and GitLab make collaboration and version management more
            efficient.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-yellow-400 mb-4">
            3. Frontend Frameworks
          </h2>
          <p className="mb-6">
            React.js continues to lead the frontend development space, with
            Next.js gaining traction for server-side rendering and static site
            generation. Don't overlook Vue.js and Svelte, which are also great
            choices.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-yellow-400 mb-4">
            4. Backend Technologies
          </h2>
          <p className="mb-6">
            Node.js remains a top choice for backend development. New frameworks
            like Deno are also gaining popularity. Cloud services such as AWS
            and Firebase are essential for scalable applications.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-yellow-400 mb-4">
            5. Testing Tools
          </h2>
          <p className="mb-6">
            Automated testing is essential for robust applications. Tools like
            Jest, Cypress, and Playwright are essential for both unit and
            end-to-end testing.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-yellow-400 mb-4">
